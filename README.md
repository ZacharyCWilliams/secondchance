## ThePenPal

The [5 year recidivism rate](https://www.fromprisoncellstophd.org/volunteer.html) for inmates within the United States state prison system sits at a staggering 76.6%. Sadly, [83% will return to prison within 9 years](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/18upr9yfup0514.pdf). At a basic human-decency level, this is unacceptable. From a financial perspective, it is also a major issue.

There are currently 2.2 million people incarcerated in the United States. Taxpayers pay on average, $31,286 a year for each prisoner. That's ~$68 billion dollars a year we're pouring into our prison system! 

Fortunately, 95% of our prisoners WILL be released from prison at some point. This means we have a tremendous opportunity to help people and reduce costs surrounding the prison system! We believe that when an issue of this magnitude presents itself, we have a **responsibility** to act. 

Here's where **ThePenPal** comes in: studies show that when a prisoner has access to, and can build relationships with, people outside of the prison system their odds of returning to prison SIGNIFICANTLY decrease (~25% decrease).

Our goal through ThePenPal is to give people a super convenient, easy to use, way to connect with inmates so that we can lift our prisoners, drop the recidivism rate, and spend the money we're currently wasting on rebuilding this nation.
