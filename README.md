## ThePenPal

The [5 year recidivism rate](https://www.fromprisoncellstophd.org/volunteer.html) for inmates within the United States state prison system sits at a staggering 76.6%. Sadly, [83% will return to prison within 9 years](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/18upr9yfup0514.pdf). At a basic human-decency level, this is unacceptable. From a financial perspective, it is also a major issue.

There are currently 2.2 million people incarcerated in the United States. Taxpayers pay on average, $31,286 a year for each prisoner. That's ~$68 billion dollars a year we're pouring into our prison system! 

Fortunately, 95% of our prisoners WILL be released from prison at some point. This means we have a tremendous opportunity to help people and reduce costs surrounding the prison system! We believe that when an issue of this magnitude presents itself, we have a **responsibility** to act. 

Here's where **ThePenPal** comes in: studies show that when a prisoner has access to, and can build relationships with, people outside of the prison system their odds of returning to prison SIGNIFICANTLY decrease (Vox reports that a single 25% decrease).

Our goal through ThePenPal is to give people a super convenient, easy to use, way to connect with inmates so that we can lift our prisoners, drop the recitivism rate, and spend the money we're currently wasting on rebuilding this nation. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
